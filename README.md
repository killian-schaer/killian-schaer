# Thanks for stopping by !

  Iâ€™m @killian-schaer. Legal advisor by day, IT enthusiast by night. Sometimes legal and IT blend together, and I love it. 
  
  Due to most of my brain cells already having been sacrificed while trying to search for a picture of me where I'm not closing my eyes or looking away, that bio may not be the most creative on GitHub.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in : legal tech, techy tech, science, medicine, medtech, aviation, transportation, pyrotechnics, politics, good cuisine (but not long 20-course meals), ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning : Working with Typo3 and discovering Office-JS
- ðŸ“« How to reach me : I like cool places. As summer approaches I may be hiding in a LN2 tank. If you can't find me, try to summon me holding an ice cold glass of Coke Zero in both hands.
