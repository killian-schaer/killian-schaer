# Thanks for stopping by !

  I’m @killian-schaer. Legal advisor by day, IT enthusiast by night. Sometimes legal and IT blend together, and I love it. 

- 👀 I’m interested in : legal tech, techy tech, science, medicine, medtech, aviation, transportation, pyrotechnics, politics, good cuisine (but not long 20-course meals), ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning : Working with Typo3 and discovering Office-JS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on : a lawyer internship (if you're a lawyer and you're reading this, there's a good chance that we'll get along !)
- 📫 How to reach me : I like cool places. As summer approaches I may be hiding in a LN2 tank. If you can't find me, try to summon me holding an ice cold glass of Coke Zero in both hands.
